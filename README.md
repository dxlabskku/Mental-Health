# A lexicon-based approach to examine depression detection in social media: the case of Twitter and university community

We provide the depression labeled dataset on Twitter posts consist of multiple languages(Korean, English and Japanese). The datasets were collected using Twitter APIs with community-based random sampling approaches and our datasets consist of 921k tweets from Korean users, 10M tweets from English users and 15M tweets from Japanese users. Each language depression dataset was labeld depression(1) or non-depression(0) with depression lexicon, which was collected from prior studies that related to the detection of depression on social media.
In addition, we applied our model to specific group(e.g. university community) to detect not only general social media posts but also specific groups posts.

## Data
Our sampled datasets are in data folder as capacity of datasets is big. We are only allowed to distribute the data for the research purpose, if you want to achieve full datasets, please complete the request form(update later).

## Experiment
We employed deep learning framework to classify depression posts in the social media and university community.
